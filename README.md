# Future of Work

Future of Work is a platform that helps people learn digital skills, apply them through real-world micro-projects, and access global earning opportunities. Using a **Learn → Do → Earn** model, it empowers anyone to grow, collaborate, and succeed from anywhere in the world.

## Vision

To bridge the gap between education and opportunity through practical skill development, inclusive collaboration, and digital-first earning models.

We believe the future of work is:
- Skills-based
- Decentralized and remote-friendly
- Powered by digital innovation and Web3 technologies

Future of Work organizes learning around “Skill Pods”:

| Builder Pod  | Build tools, apps, automations |
| Creator Pod  | Create stories, content, brand identity |
| Educator Pod | Teach through content and structured learning |

Users engage in real tasks, projects, mentorship, and earn rewards tied to performance and contribution.
